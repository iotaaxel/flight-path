# flight_path

Overview: 
- In order to determine the flight path of a person, we must sort through all of their flight records.

Goal (WIP): 
- Create a microservice API to track a given personâ€™s flight path. 

Requirements (WIP): 
- The API should accept a request that includes a list of flights, which are defined by a source and destination airport code. 

- The API must listen on port 8080 and expose the flight path tracker under /calculate endpoint

Considerations: 
- These flights may not be listed in order and will need to be sorted to find the total flight paths starting and ending airports.

Example Runs: 

- Example 1: 
  ```
  Input:    [['SFO','EWR']]
  Result:   ['SFO', 'EWR']
  Explanation: An individual only took one trip (nonstop flight).
  ```
- Example 2: 
  ```
  Input:    [['ATL', 'EWR'], ['SFO', 'ATL']] 
  Result:   ['SFO', 'EWR']
  Explanation: Once sorted by airport code, you get `[['SFO', 'ATL'], ['ATL', 'EWR']]` and report the starting and ending airports.
  ```

- Example 3: 
  ```
  Input:    [['IND', 'EWR'], ['SFO', 'ATL'], ['GSO', 'IND'], ['ATL', 'GSO']]
  Result:   ['SFO', 'EWR']
  Explanation: Once sorted by airport code, you get `[['SFO', 'ATL'], ['ATL', 'GSO'], ['GSO', 'IND'], ['IND', 'EWR']]` and report the starting and ending airports.
